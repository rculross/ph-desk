# Custom Metrics: NULL vs. Zero Values

Zero values pushed in via custom metrics could be counted either as "null"/missed values or actual zero value. You can decide which is the right one for your use cases, and a Planhat "Super Admin" (staff member) can help you edit it.

## What the setting does:

- **"Yes"**: days with "0" value will now count as a "0"
- **"No"**: days with "0" values will count as null

## Practical examples:

Let's assume we have 3 different custom metrics being pushed in to Planhat, found in the table below.

| | Day 1 | Day 2 | Day 3 | Day 4 | Day 5 |
|---------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Log-ins | 7 | 5 | 9 | 0 | 4 |
| Temp (CÂ°) | 22 | 15 | 15 | 0 | 17 |
| NPS | 5 | 3 | 7 | 0 | 5 |

The question, which the setting is for, is how to look at Day 4's data.

- **Log-ins:** most likely 0 log-ins on Day 4 > setting should be "Yes"
- **Temperature:** most likely missing data on Day 4 > setting should be "No"
- **NPS:** most likely missing data on Day 4 > setting should be "No"

In other words: when you push in data where 0 means 0, the setting should be "on". The most common use cases for this is when pushing in usage activities, since it's a "counter"-type metric where 0 is the starting point. In the Temperature and NPS case, there is no "starting point" at 0, which means 0 likely means "no value":

Note that days with no values will always be counted as null.

## The implications:

Whether the setting is Yes/No mostly impacts subsequent calculated metrics, e.g., when using the "LAST" operator or do averages over time. Using the "Log-ins" example above:

If I use the "LAST" operator on Day 4, then:

- If "Yes", then Day 4 = 0 and so the last value is 0
- If "No", then Day 4 = null and so the last value is Day 3 = 9 > Day 4 = 9

If I use the "Average" operator on Day 1-5, then:

- If "Yes", then Day 4 has a value and is included in the average calculation, which produces an average of 5 (25/5)
- If "No", then Day 5 does not have a value and is not included in the average calculation, which produces an average of 6.25 (25/4)

**Note:** this is a global setting for all custom metrics. If you have multiple metrics that have different logics (like the three above), then you can:

- Transform the data you push in (e.g., turning the Day 4 value for log-ins from 0 to null before pushing it into Planhat)
- Prioritize value of accuracy between the metrics, and set logic accordingly
